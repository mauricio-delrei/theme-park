Theme Park Marketing Website
Project Overview
This project involves the development of a promotional marketing website for a new theme park. The aim of the website is to highlight the various themed areas, rides, and attractions of the park in an engaging and visually appealing way, while ensuring core information such as park hours, FAQs, and contact details are easily accessible.

Scenario
The theme park owners have provided creative freedom in terms of branding and design, allowing the website to be developed in a way that aligns with the overall park theme and appeals to the intended audience. This is not a ticket-selling website; therefore, functionality for purchasing or booking tickets is not required.

Core Requirements
The website must meet the following minimum requirements:

Themed Areas
The park consists of multiple themed areas, each featuring its own rides and attractions. These areas must be represented clearly on the website with relevant visuals and descriptions.

Rides & Attractions
Each themed area includes a set of rides and attractions. These must be showcased appropriately, ensuring users can explore the different experiences available within each area.

Opening Hours
The park is open every day from April to October, from 9am to 7pm. This information must be clearly displayed on the website, preferably on the homepage and other relevant sections.

FAQ Page
The website must include a dedicated FAQ page to address common queries visitors might have, such as parking, food, and park policies.

Contact Us Page
A Contact Us page must be included with a functional HTML form, allowing visitors to submit queries or feedback. This form should collect basic details such as name, email address, and message content.

Additional Notes on Design
You have creative freedom to style and design the website as you see fit. However, you must ensure that the theme is appropriate for the park and aligns with the target audience. The theme of the park could be focused on families, thrill-seekers, or a mix of both.

Examples for inspiration:

Thorpe Park: Focuses on thrill rides with an edgy, adrenaline-filled theme.
Paultons Park: Family-friendly, with specific themed areas for young children (e.g., Peppa Pig World) and more general areas (e.g., Tornado Springs).
Chessington World of Adventures: Combines rides with a zoo and a Sealife area, providing a broad entertainment experience.
Tasks
